# 📊 Excel_Projects

## 👋 Welcome!
If you’ve ever thought Excel was “just for accountants,” think again!  
This repository is my growing collection of **Excel-based data analysis projects** — real datasets turned into insights, visuals, and interactive dashboards.

## 📂 What’s Inside
This repo includes:
- ✅ **Raw datasets** – straight from the source
- ✨ **Cleaned data** – after applying data wrangling techniques
- 📈 **Interactive dashboards** – built with slicers, KPI cards, and clear visuals
- 📝 **Documentation** – formulas, logic, and approach explained
- 🖼 **Screenshots** – so you can preview dashboards without downloading

## 🔍 Skills Showcased
- Data cleaning with Excel functions like:
  - `TRIM`, `SUBSTITUTE`, `IF`, `VLOOKUP`, `XLOOKUP`, `TEXT`
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using PivotTables & PivotCharts
- KPI card creation for business insights
- Chart types: Column, Bar, Pie, Line, Area, and more
- Dashboard design with slicers and clean layouts

## 📊 Example Project: **NIMASA ICT Inventory Dashboard**
- Tracks ICT equipment across departments
- Highlights **most** & **least requested** equipment
- Categorizes assets into **Computers, Display Devices, Imaging Devices, Power Supply**
- Includes interactive slicers for quick filtering

## 💡 My Goal
To show that **Excel is more than rows and columns** — it’s a storytelling tool for data.  
I approach every project as both a data analyst **and** a curious learner, breaking down complex concepts into something anyone can understand.

## 🚀 How to Explore
1. Open any project file in Excel (latest version recommended).
2. Click through the slicers and charts.
3. Explore the formulas in the calculation sheets to see the logic.

## 🖤 Final Note
If you’re learning Excel, feel free to explore, take inspiration, and even recreate these projects.  
Data analysis isn’t just about *crunching numbers* — it’s about *understanding the story behind them*.
