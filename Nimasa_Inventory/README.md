# NIMASA Inventory Management Dashboard
This project is part of my internship as an ICT Intern at the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA).
The goal was to streamline inventory tracking, analyze equipment requests, and create interactive dashboards for decision-making.

I worked on data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation using Microsoft Excel, transforming raw ICT equipment request logs into actionable insights.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Data Cleaning (Removing duplicates, correcting errors, categorizing items)
- Formulas: VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting
- KPI Cards for at-a-glance metrics
- Slicers for dynamic filtering
- Data Visualization
- Interactive Dashboard with charts, KPIs, and filters

## Key Insights Delivered
- Total Equipment Count for all departments
- Most Requested Equipment and Least Requested Equipment
- Category Classification (e.g., Computers, Imaging Devices, Power Supply, etc.)
- Equipment Request Breakdown by Department and Category

## What Makes This Project Stand Out
Real industry data from a Nigerian government agency (sanitized for confidentiality)

**End-to-end data workflow:** from cleaning â†’ analysis â†’ visualization
Professional dashboard design optimized for management decision-making

I enjoy turning messy datasets into clear, beautiful dashboards that drive real decisions and break down complex problems into simple solutions. If you're into data analytics or dashboarding, let's connect!
