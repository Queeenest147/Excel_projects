# 📊 Revenue and Customer Trends Dashboard (Excel Project)

This project showcases an end-to-end data analysis workflow entirely within Microsoft Excel. The goal was to transform raw transactional data into a fully interactive dashboard, moving from data cleaning and preparation to pivot tables and finally to dynamic visualizations that reveal key business insights.

## 🛠️ What I Did: Key Tasks & Features
### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed invalid entries, such as records with negative prices or quantities.
- Created 3 extra Columns to narrow down the date of purchase in terms of days, months and years
- Also calculated the profit gained from each sale made.
- Created a measure using DAX
- Created a dedicated **Calculations Sheet** to derive important metrics:
  - `Total Revenue = Price × Quantity`
  - Average Order Value (AOV)
  - Customer Purchase Frequency
  - Profit Margin Estimates
  - Revenue Frequency and Monetary Analysis
  - Elasticity based on the top Products that generated the highest revenue
  - Scenario Table showing the increase in revenue based on the changes of the average prices of  the products

### Pivot Tables for Analysis
I created several pivot tables to summarise the data and explore different trends:
#### Revenue by Country

#### Countries with the highest sales

### KPI Cards
The Key performance indicators were created using pivot tables that were linked to the data model for an at-a-glance summary of the business health.
- ✅ Total Revenue  
- ✅ Total Products Sold
- ✅ Total Customers (Distinct Count)
- ✅ Average Revenue per Customer
- ✅ Top Customer

### Interactive Dashboard
The final dashboard was built from the ground up with a focus on user experience and interactivity.
- Designed a clean layout using shapes and a custom colour palette.
##### Integrated dynamic filtering tools for such as:
  
- **Slicers** (Country, Product, Customer)

##### Included a variety of visualisations:
  - 📈 Line chart for revenue trends over time.
  - 📊 Bar charts for top products and customers.
  - 🌍 Map chart for a geographical view of revenue.
  - 🍩 Doughnut charts to show share-of-revenue.
