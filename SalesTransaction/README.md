# 📊 Revenue and Customer Trends Dashboard (Excel Project)

This project showcases an end-to-end data analysis workflow entirely within Microsoft Excel. The goal was to transform raw transactional data into a fully interactive dashboard, moving from data cleaning and preparation to pivot tables and finally to dynamic visualizations that reveal key business insights.

## 🛠️ What I Did: Key Tasks & Features
### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed invalid entries, such as records with negative prices or quantities.
- Created a dedicated **Calculations Sheet** to derive important metrics:
  - `Total Revenue = Price × Quantity`
  - Average Order Value (AOV)
  - Customer Purchase Frequency
  - Profit Margin Estimates

*My Project comprises four Excel sheets as explained below:*

### Pivot Tables for Analysis
I created several pivot tables to summarise the data and explore different trends:
#### Revenue by Country  


#### Countries with the highest sales 

#### Top Products by Revenue 📦

#### Top Products that drive sales 

3### Top Customers by Revenue 🧑‍🤝‍🧑


### KPI Cards
Key performance indicators were created and linked to the data model for an at-a-glance summary of the business health:
- ✅ Total Revenue
- ✅ Total Products Sold
- ✅ Total Customers (Distinct Count)
- ✅ Average Revenue per Customer
- ✅ Average Revenue per Transaction

### Interactive Dashboard
The final dashboard was built from the ground up with a focus on user experience and interactivity.
- Designed a clean layout using shapes and a custom color palette.
- Integrated **Slicers** (Country, Product, Customer) and a **Timeline** for dynamic filtering.
- Included a variety of visualizations:
  - 📈 Line chart for revenue trends over time.
  - 📊 Bar charts for top products and customers.
  - 🌍 Map chart for a geographical view of revenue.
  - 🍩 Donut charts to show share-of-revenue.
  - 🟩 Tree map to visualize product category contributions.
